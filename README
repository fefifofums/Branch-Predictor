This is the infrastructure for the branch prediction competition for COSC 3330 Computer Architecure, Assignment 2.  The goal
is to implement a C++ branch predition class that reads trace and simulates Nehalem dynamic branch predictor.  My code was written
and tested on Fedora 25.  Please see src/my_predictor.h for my implementation.
